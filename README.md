# "Project 0: Search" at Harvard's CS50 online course.

The project has been deployed via GitHub Pages -> https://nurme-ave.github.io/CS50-Project-0/

This project received a passing grade by the CS50 staff. There was no automated check, the project was checked manually by the CS50 graders.

This assignment also required a screencast where I demonstrated my project's functionality. In that screencast I did not have to show my code as this was submitted and reviewed separately. The screencast can be viewed here -> https://youtu.be/b8JZC48hvng
