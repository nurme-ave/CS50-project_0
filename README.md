# "Project 0: Search" at Harvard's CS50 online course.

This project received a passing grade by the CS50 staff. There was no automated check, the project was checked manually by the CS50 graders.

I had to do a screencast where I demonstrated my project's functionality. In that screencast I did not have to show my code as this was submitted and reviewed separately.
